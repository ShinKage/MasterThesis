@article{belardinelli_quantified_2021,
	title = {Quantified Modal Logic and the Ontology of Physical Objects},
	abstract = {In the present paper I aim at introducing a formal framework to deal with persistence and change of material objects in time. I first consider three main ontological theories: perdurantism ((6), (7), (16)), endurantism ((18)) and sequen- tialism ((2)); then develop a formal account for these theories, by making use of semantics for quantified modal logics: Kripke semantics ((3), (10)), the substantial interpretation ((5)) and counterpart semantics ((1)) respectively. I show that each interpretation soundly formalizes the corresponding ontological account, by referring to three features of these semantics: (i) the nature of indi- viduals appearing in the domains of these structures, (ii) the principles on identity sound with respect to each account, (iii) the representation and solution of onto- logical problems within the logical frameworks. I conclude that Kripke semantics, the substantial interpretation and counterpart semantics are a sound formalization for perdurantism, endurantism and sequentialism respectively. Finally I outline some applications of these formalisms, in order to cope with the problem of comparing and reducing ontologies. By means of results in (4) and (9), I single out the necessary and sucient conditions according to which an endurantist, a perdurantist and a sequentialist can meaningfully talk to each other. In the end I stress the role that logics - in particular quantified modal logic - can play in analysing ontological issues as persistence and change for material objects, thus improving our comprehension of the logical consequences of our ontological theses, and of the relationships among the various accounts. In the present paper I aim at introducing a formal framework to deal with the ontological issues of persistence and change for individuals in time. In the last years there has been a renewal of the debate on persistence conditions for physical objects; several proposals are available in the literature, which can be roughly divided into three main accounts.},

Graphs are an intuitive representation of states of these systems, where transitions can be conveniently described by graph transformation rules. We present a framework for the abstraction of graphs supporting abstract graph transformation. The abstraction method naturally generalises previous approaches to abstract graph transformation. The set of possible abstract graphs is finite. This has the pleasant consequence of generating a finite transition system for any start graph and any finite set of transformation rules. Moreover, abstraction preserves a simple logic for expressing properties on graph nodes. The precision of the abstraction can be adjusted according to properties expressed in this logic to be verified.},
